This files describes API changes for the core question system.

=== 3.0, 2.9.2, 2.8.8 ===

1) The extra internal PARAM constant question_attempt::PARAM_MARK should no
   longer be used. (It should not have been used outside the core of the
   question system). See MDL-51090 if you want more explanation.


=== 2.6 ===

1) The method question_behaviour::is_manual_grade_in_range and move and become
question_engine::is_manual_grade_in_range.

2) The arguments to core_question_renderer::mark_summary changed from
($qa, $options) to ($qa, $behaviouroutput, $options). If you have overridden
that method you will need to update your code.

3) Heading level for number(), add_part_heading() and respond_history()
has been lowered by one level. These changes are part of improving the page
accessibility and making heading to have proper nesting. (MDL-41615)
